# AlwaysShowZoom
### Minimal Chrome &amp; Edge Extension to always show the Zoom Button (Magnify icon in the URL box)

### Get AlwaysShowZoom on the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/always-show-zoom/gjmgohadapodpamhimnnjnkjgnodljfe)

This has been outstanding for years as tracked at the following pages:
- [Chrome Zoom Icon always visible - Google Chrome Community](https://support.google.com/chrome/thread/48061536/chrome-zoom-icon-always-visible?hl=en)
- [Always show Zoom button | Microsoft Community Hub](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/discussions/edgeinsiderdiscussions/always-show-zoom-button/2013389/replies/2013432)

To keep the button from disappearing, this extension tweaks the zoom by an almost imperceptible 0.1% when it is at the default level. There is one side effect when repeatedly resetting (ctrl-0) where it will toggle between the default and the next increased zoom level.

For a button to zoom in with a single click, pin the extension in the toolbar.
